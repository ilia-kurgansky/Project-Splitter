# Project-Splitter
QR-based exam script creator and splitter

Based on the core approach here: https://github.com/christofsteel/split_qr_exam (thank you!) and with a thousand lines of changes to allow creation/modification of scripts from raw PDF files and data lists, a well as filing, sorting and maintaining a tracker of submissions.

Developed for the 2021 COVID exam season - to distribute individualised PDFs to students, conduct exams on paper and then efficiently digitise over 9000 scripts, filing individual papers into corresponding digital folders.
